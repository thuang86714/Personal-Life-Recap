## Question to keep in mind:

A colleague of mine, we met in the office after working hours. He didn't know i was prepping for Google Interviews. I told him I was studying for AWS certifications and working on some other side projects. He was not surprised at all. He always said I deserved places way better than the current company, even though only a handful of software companies are better than the current one.

Then we talked about working out, and shared the numbers we could do in gym. He told me that, based on my muscular-ish appearance, I could totally push myself harder. I knew I could do better at work and in gym, but I was, in a way, satisfied then.

After that night, I start to think maybe I actually underestimated myself?

This story seeded in my brain and becomes the question to keep in mind:
**Am I underestimating myself?**
